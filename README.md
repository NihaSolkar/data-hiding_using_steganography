# 🖼️ Image Steganography using Python  
An **End-to-End Python program** to **hide secret messages in images** using **Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography**.  
This project allows you to **securely encode and decode hidden messages** in images using **OpenCV, NumPy, and PIL**.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Hides Messages in Images Without Changing Their Appearance**  
✅ **Uses Least Significant Bit (LSB) Encoding for High Security**  
✅ **Encodes and Decodes Messages Securely**  
✅ **Works on Any Image Format (JPG, PNG, BMP, etc.)**  
✅ **Lightweight and Fast Execution**  
✅ **No Need for an Internet Connection**  
✅ **Open-Source and Easily Modifiable**

## 📌 How It Works
🔹 **Encoding:** Hides a secret message inside an image by modifying the **least significant bits** of pixel values.  
🔹 **Decoding:** Extracts the hidden message from the image by analyzing the **least significant bits**.
